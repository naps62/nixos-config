3. Ask clarifying questions if necessary
4. Understand the prior art for this issue

6. Document your plan

# CREATE

- Solve the issue in small, manageable steps, according to your plan.
- Commit your changes after each step.

# TEST
- Write tests to describe the expected behavior of your code
- Run the full test suite to ensure you haven't broken anything
